# KP Kustoms

KP Kustoms is the one stop shop for purchasing handmade one of a kind crochet pieces.

Designed to fill the gap between professionalism and expensive fees in hosting a website for a small business, and also my capstone project for BrainStation's Software Engineering Diploma bootcamp. This is a work in progress, and will continue to be updated.

## API References

To successfully host an eCommerce website, a checkout process is needed. To achieve this, test keys have been set up to use the Stripe Checkout API. Below is test card details to use during the checkout process.

```
Brand - Visa
Number - 4242424242424242
CVV - any 3 digits
Expiry Date - any date in the future
```

## To Do's

There's still lots to work on, so here's a few things in progress.

- Detailed Stripe API integration to implement shipping costs, taxxes and other transactional tickets to ensure a smooth checkout.
- Updating products to include more size information and detail in sizing.
